# Advent of Code
## 2021
For my first year, I chose C. Due to time constraints, I only aimed to get the first star of each puzzle. I made it to day 19, which I'm quite happy with overall.

## 2022
This year, I went with python. Due to even more time constraints, I restricted myself to 30 minutes per star.
